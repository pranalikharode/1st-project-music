      <p class="sectionSubTag ">Experts are trying to understand how our brains can hear and play music. A stereo system puts out vibrations that travel through the air and somehow get inside the ear canal. These vibrations tickle the eardrum and are transmitted into an electrical signal that travels through the auditory nerve to the brain stem, where it is reassembled into something we perceive as music.
        Johns Hopkins researchers have had dozens of jazz performers and rappers improvise music while lying down inside an fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) machine to watch and see which areas of their brains light up.
        Music is structural, mathematical and architectural. Its based on relationships between one note and the next. You may not be aware of it, but your brain has to do a lot of computing to make sense of it.</p>

      <p class="sectionTag text-big">It boosts your creativity</p>
      <p class="sectionSubTag ">As humans, creativity is one of our greatest assets. Not only does it allow us to create art, but it also helps with problem-solving and creating better products and services. This makes it a core competency in almost any role.
        According to one study, listening to happy music — such as arousing or uplifting classical music — can enhance your creativity.The part of the brain called the amygdala is responsible for processing music. It’s also the center of our mood and emotions. That’s why listening to upbeat music can help put you in a more positive mood.
        Therefore, listening to happy music regularly can help regulate your brain chemistry. This can help you maintain greater mental and emotional balance.</p>

      <p class="sectionTag text-big">It can increase your motivation</p>
      <p class="sectionSubTag ">In one study, researchers wanted to test the effect of music on the motivation levels of cyclists on static bikes. To do this, they changed the tempo of the music without the participants’ knowledge. 
        When they increased the tempo by 10%, the cyclists’ performance increased in terms of distance, pedaling speed, and power exerted. Decreasing the speed of the music by 10% had the opposite effect. This suggests that the higher-tempo music increased their motivation.</p>
